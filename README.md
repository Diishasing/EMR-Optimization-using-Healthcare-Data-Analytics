<h3 align="left">Background and Overview</h3><p align="justify">This project leverages synthetic Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data to extract actionable insights into patient care, operational efficiency, and financial performance. The data was processed using Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA), MS SQL Server for data cleaning and transformation, and Power BI for interactive dashboard development.

The analysis focuses on key areas such as patient outcomes, cost management, readmission rates, and resource allocation, helping hospital administrators make informed, data-driven decisions. Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

Readmission rates and high-risk patient groups

Departmental performance, patient satisfaction, and operational efficiency

Financial trends, revenue opportunities, and insurance coverage</p>

<h3>DATA OVERVIEW</h3>
Synthetic Data Generation: Due to privacy regulations like HIPAA, the project used synthetically generated EMR data (via Python‚Äôs Faker library) to simulate real-world patient records.

Key Data Fields:

Patient Demographics: Age, gender, race

Vital Signs: Blood pressure, heart rate, glucose levels

Diagnoses: ICD-10 codes

Procedures: CPT codes for surgeries

Insurance Coverage: Treatment costs, patient satisfaction scores

Readmission Info: Indicators of patient readmissions

This synthetic data mimicked real hospital scenarios to provide a framework for insights without using sensitive patient data.

<h3>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h3>
Overview of Findings
Key metrics and trends were uncovered:

Patient Readmission Rates: 1 in 3 adults with diabetes (ICD-10 E11.9) were readmitted within two months, indicating high-risk groups that require better post-discharge care.

Revenue Trends: ER and Orthopedics departments generated the highest revenue per patient, especially from seniors and adults.

Operational Efficiency: Cardiology, Oncology, and Pediatrics experienced peak activity in specific months (March, June, July, and February), signaling the need for strategic resource allocation during these periods.

Trends Chronic Conditions: Chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease showed an upward trend in summer months, offering opportunities for preventive care programs.

Patient Satisfaction Decline: Orthopedics saw a significant drop in patient satisfaction post-July 2024, likely due to resource strain and operational inefficiencies.

Insurance Coverage Gaps: Over 10% of patients were uninsured, with private insurance covering 40% of patients, presenting a gap in patient access to care.

Performance Department Efficiency: Oncology and ER departments had high readmission rates, leading to lower patient satisfaction.

Revenue Per Patient: ER and Orthopedics showed the highest revenue per patient, driven by specialized care and advanced surgical options.

<h3>JOURNEY INSIGHTS</h3>
<li>
  <b>Insight-1</b>: The readmission rates for diabetes (ICD-10 E11.9) are concerning, with one in three adults being readmitted within two months. This highlights the importance of effective post-discharge care, patient education, and at-home monitoring to minimize preventable readmissions.
</li>
<li>
  <b>Insight-2</b>: The Cardiology, Oncology, and Pediatrics departments experience increased activity during specific months (March, June, July, and February). This trend provides an opportunity to strategically allocate resources during these peak times to enhance operational efficiency and reduce patient wait times.
</li>
<li>
 <b>Insight-3</b>: Patient satisfaction in Orthopedics has significantly declined since July 2024. This decline is likely attributed to high patient volume and resource strain, indicating a need for improvements in service quality, communication, and facility enhancements.
</li>
<li>
  <b>Insight-4</b>: The ER and Oncology departments have received lower patient ratings, likely due to elevated readmission rates and treatment costs. Improving discharge processes and follow-up care could enhance patient satisfaction and outcomes.
</li>
<li>
  <b>Insight-5</b>:More than 10% of patients lack insurance, while private insurance covers 40%. Expanding financial assistance programs and negotiating better insurance coverage could enhance patient access to care and lower financial barriers.
</li>
<h3>RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
<li>
<b>Enhancing Follow-Up Care for High-Risk Patients</b>: To decrease readmission rates for chronic conditions such as diabetes (ICD-10 E11.9), implementing focused follow-up programs is essential. A 10% reduction in readmissions could lead to significant cost savings for the hospital while enhancing patient outcomes.
</li>

<li>
<b>Optimizing Resource Allocation</b>: The Cardiology, Oncology, and Pediatrics departments require additional resources during peak months (March, June, July, and February) to ensure operational efficiency. By reallocating 5% of staffing resources during these times, the hospital can decrease patient wait times and improve service quality.
</li>

<li>
<b>Revitalize the Orthopedics Department</b>: With a 10% decline in patient satisfaction since July 2024, enhancing patient communication, service quality, and facilities could help reverse this trend. Aiming for a 10% increase in satisfaction could lead to improved patient retention and further revenue growth in Orthopedics.  
</li>

<li>
<b>Lower Readmission Rates in ER and Oncology</b>: Investing in improved discharge protocols and follow-up care for patients in the ER and Oncology departments can enhance satisfaction scores and reduce readmission rates. A 5% decrease in readmissions can lead to substantial cost savings and better patient outcomes.
</li>

<li>
Enhance Insurance Coverage and Financial Assistance: By negotiating improved agreements with insurance providers and expanding financial assistance programs, the hospital can increase the number of insured patients by 10%. This will enhance patient access to care and boost hospital revenue.
